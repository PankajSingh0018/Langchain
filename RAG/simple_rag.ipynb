We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\nâ€¦\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between usâ€”however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendshipâ€”exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our heartsâ€”for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10. (Image source: Google Blog, 2020)\\nCheck more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.\\nComponent Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\\n\\nGOALS:\\n\\n1. {{user-provided goal 1}}\\n2. {{user-provided goal 2}}\\n3. ...\\n4. ...\\n5. ...\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

In\\norder to do so, we used a BERT model that was pre-trained in Portuguese vocabulary and fine-tuned it\\nto our concrete classification problem, NER.

       " Document(page_content='2. Related Work\\nIn recent years we witnessed an increase in performance of several NLP tasks due to the new\\nresearch in ML applied to text processing. In [ 3] Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo)\\nwere introduced, presenting a feature-based approach that generates deep contextualized word\\nvectors where the words’ representations were functions of all the internal layers of the model.\\nBy taking into account not only the word’s syntax and semantics but also their context meaning,\\nthe same token would have different representations when used in different contexts.\\nThen, in [ 4], the authors presented ULMFiT, where they pre-trained a model with a huge\\ndataset containing more than 100 million words [ 5]. By fine-tuning this pre-trained model, it\\nwas reused for different NLP tasks enabling generalization with only 100 labeled examples.\\nIn [6] they created a new architecture, Transformers, with the self-attention mechanism\\nthat drastically increased the efficiency of text processing, allowing to create bigger and richer\\nmodels with higher knowledge of the language vocabulary.\\nShortly after that, new models were developed that used the transformers architecture and\\nachieved SOTA results in several NLP tasks, both on sentence and token level, such as BERT [ 7]\\nand GPT [ 8].\\n3. NER@DI\\nNER@DI is a web platform created to provide various natural language processing tools associ-\\nated with Named Entity Recognition. This platform was born as a result of a research [ 1] about\\nthe processing of Portuguese archival documents, where several NER models were generated\\nusing different ML algorithms and architectures. However, several limitations of this NLP field\\nin Portuguese were identified during this work. So in order to promote research in this area, the\\nNER@DI platform makes the created resources in [ 1] available to the public, such as Portuguese\\narchival annotated corpora, tools to support the annotation of new corpora, and, of course, the\\ngenerated ML models.\\n3.1. Architecture\\nThis platform was created with the intent of being complemented with new features in the\\nfuture. Thus, a micro-service architecture was used, promoting looser coupling, more flexibility,\\nand portability.\\nAt the moment, it has two containers that correspond to the Data API and the API Gateway.\\nThe API Gateway is implemented with an Nginx web server containing the client application,\\ndeveloped in Vue.js, a framework that uses reactive interfaces. The use of an API Gateway\\npattern makes the client less coupled to the micro-services, i. e., it does not need to know the\\ninternal structure of the server to communicate with the application. The use of this pattern\\nmeans that there are no direct references between the client and the microservices, so the\\nrefactoring and maintenance of these will have a lower impact to the client. On the other hand,\\nif a gateway server was not used, all microservices would be exposed to the public, which could\\nlead to security issues. Then, Vue.js was used to create the client application. It has a small\\nlearning curve, so it is fairly approachable, allowing the creation of maintainable interfaces', metadata={'source': 'fine_tuning_bert.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

To\\ncomplement this framework, Vuetify was used, which consists of a UI library that provides\\nseveral pre-made reactive components.\\nThe second container is the Data API, which is responsible for receiving, processing and\\nresponding to HTTP requests, in this case, associated with the extraction of entities. For\\nthis, a Node.js server was used, complemented by [ 9] library, which works like a broker that is\\nresponsibleformanagingtheAPIroutesanddelegatingtheNERprocessingtothecorresponding\\ntools. The Machine Learning models were implemented with OpenNLP, spaCy, Tensorflow and\\nBERT so, to process NER requests, the Node.js server uses the child_process [10] library, creating\\nnew processes to execute programs in python and java. When the execution of the programs\\nfinishes, the created processes return the output to the Node.js server, which is responsible for\\nreturning the response to the client in JSON format.\\nFinally, in order to deploy this platform, each micro-service was wrapped with a docker\\ncontainer. These containers promote the isolation, scalability, agility and portability of each\\nmicro-service since it is really easy to install a containerized application in any system that has\\ndocker running. At the moment, NER@DI is hosted on the servers of the University of Minho’s\\nInformatics Department, at [ 11].\\n3.2. Features\\nDuring the development of the NER models, several support tools were generated. Some of\\nthese tools were selected and implemented in NER@DI in order to make them available to the\\npublic. Most of NER@DI features are described in [ 2], thus, this paper only present the newly\\nadded ones:\\n•Addition of a new model (BERT) trained on Portuguese Archival Finding Aids that allows\\nto perform NER.\\n•Creation of a documented API that allows NER@DI users to use the NER models as a\\nservice in other applications.', metadata={'source': 'fine_tuning_bert.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Now we present a BERT model, which consists of using pre-trained models\\nwith hundreds of thousands of parameters and leveraging the knowledge acquired during their\\npre-train by fine-tuning them on a specific task, in our case, NER. In this paper we will present\\nthe BERT model in more detail. The other models were described in [ 1].\\n4.1. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\\nBy training models from scratch, we randomly initialize the models’ weights, which means that\\nthe model only learns from the training data. However, what if, instead of creating completely\\nnew models, we re-utilize pre-trained models and fine-tune them to our concrete classification\\ntask? By doing so we could leverage the knowledge that the model obtained during its pre-\\ntrain, in a huge amounts of textual data, towards our goal. In practice, we would be using the\\npre-trained model weights, which would provide the model with a statistical understanding of\\nthe language vocabulary, and then fine-tune the model with a task-specific classifier. That’s\\nwhat BERT models do.\\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [ 7] is a transformer based\\nmodel focused on the encoder architecture. Since these models are pre-trained with many\\ndata, they have large dimensions, reaching billions of parameters, which makes their training\\nprocess, resource and time expensive. This process requires a large number of GPUs, and can\\ntake several days or even weeks consuming high amounts of energy.\\nIn this paper we intended to process Portuguese text so we used BERT models pretrained in\\nPortuguese corpora. First we have BERTimbau [ 12]with two variants associated with the model\\nsize,”bert-base-portuguese-cased” andbert-large-portuguese-cased” models, with 110M and\\n330M parameters respectively [ 12]. These models were trained in a Brazilian Portuguese\\ncorpus composed of 2.7 billion [ 13] tokens. Secondly, there is a multilingual model, bert-base-\\nmultilingual-cased [ 14] with 110M parameters, trained on the largest Wikipedia texts, making\\nthis model capable of processing texts in 104 different languages, Portuguese included.\\nOut of curiosity, at the moment, the largest existing model was created by the cooperation\\nbetween Microsoft and Nvidia, published in October 2021, Megatron-Turing Natural Language', metadata={'source': 'fine_tuning_bert.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

[ 16] states that the pre-trained models can be biased to their training data. In this\\npaper, they analysed the GPT-3 model’s biases towards gender, race, and religion, however, they\\nstate that the model may express other categories of bias. In practice, regarding the religion bias,\\nthis behaviour made the model associate words such as ”Islam” with”terrorism” . As for genre\\nbias, the ”female” word was usually associated with tokens such as ”naughty” or”beautiful”\\nwhile the ”male”word is associated with the tokens ”large”, and”lazy”.\\n4.1.1. Sub-word Tokenizer\\nFor an ML statistical model to be able to interpret natural text, it is necessary to transform\\nthe text into numerical representations capable of transmitting the meaning of that text to the\\nmachine. These representations are the starting point for the ML models, so the higher the\\namount of information contained in them, the better their interpretation will be, conditioning\\nthe performance of the entire ML process. One technique for creating these representations is\\ntokenization.\\nIn NLP, this technique has been studied and widely used in several areas of token processing,\\nsuch as NER. In this case, word-based tokenizers are usually used, i.e., defining a fixed size 𝑁\\nfor the vocabulary and then associating an id for the 𝑁most frequent words of that vocabulary.\\nThis method has shown good results in several contexts, however, it has several limitations.\\nDue to the fact that the number of words is limited, ML models have difficulties dealing with\\nout of vocabulary words or even words that are rarely used. One solution for this problem is\\nto increase the number of vocabulary words ( 𝑁), however, this would lead to other problems\\nsuch as making the computational model heavier and increasing the number of rare words. On\\nthe other hand, as each distinct word has a different id, similar words have entirely different\\nmeanings, which causes information about the words’ relationship to be lost during this phase,\\ndecreasing the performance of the models.\\nThus, in order to solve these limitations and increase the meaning of the numerical represen-\\ntations, modelslikeBERTuseadifferenttechnique, sub-wordtokenization. Thismethodaimsto\\ndecomposerarewordsintosub-words,keepingthemostfrequentwordsintact. Infact,observing\\na given vocabulary, words like ”tokenization” can be decomposed into two sub-words ”token”\\nand”ization” . Using a word-based tokenizer, the words ”token” and”tokenization” would\\nhave representations with entirely different meanings, however, with a sub-word tokenizer, by\\nsplitting the word ”tokenization” into two sub-words, the model can learn that this word is\\ncomposed of sub-words that it already knows. In this case, the model associates the word tok-\\nenization to the most frequent word ”token” thus answering the problem of out-of-vocabulary\\nwords and maintaining a vocabulary with a reasonable size [ 17].\\nModels that use this method have increased their accuracy, mainly in the classification of\\nunknown words [ 18].', metadata={'source': 'fine_tuning_bert.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

As for\\nentities, we annotated more than 36 thousand of entities in total. All the annotated corpora can\\nbe downloaded in the NER@DI platform.\\n6. Data processing\\nAfter selecting our models’, we started the data loading and transformation process. First,\\nwe loaded the training and validation data into memory and then, we started to tokenization\\nprocess, mapping all the tokens into their corresponding ids in the pre-trained vocabulary. The\\ntraining samples must comply with the pre-trained vocabulary, having the same format and\\nstructure, which means that the tokenizer used for the pre-training must be the same for the\\nfine-tuning. Transformer-based models usually use sub-word tokenizers, meaning that the\\nrarest words of the vocabulary are usually split into sub-words.\\nListing 1: Text sequence encoding.\\n# Original\\n[ ’ Pelo ’ , ’ qual ’ , ’ foram ’ , ’ identificados ’ , ’ os ’ , ’ bachareis ’ , ’ que ’ , ’ seriam\\n’ , ’ desembargadores ’ , ’ da ’ , ’ Relação ’ , ’ e ’ , ’ Casa ’ , ’ do ’ , ’ Porto ’ , ’. ’]\\n#Tokenized\\n[ ’[CLS] ’ , ’ Pelo ’ , ’ qual ’ , ’ foram ’ , ’ identificados ’ , ’ os ’ , ’ ba ’ , ’## char ’ , ’##\\nei ’ , ’## s ’ , ’ que ’ , ’ seriam ’ , ’ desembar ’ , ’## gadores ’ , ’ da ’ , ’ Rela ’ , ’## ção\\n’ , ’ e ’ , ’ Casa ’ , ’ do ’ , ’ Porto ’ , ’. ’ , ’[ SEP ] ’]\\nEven if the training data is already tokenized in IOB format, we have to tokenize it again\\nto create the correct correspondence between the training data and the pre-train vocabulary\\nid. In Listing 1the tokens ”bachareis” and”desembargadores” were divided into smaller sub-\\ntokens. Consequently, since we changed the sequence vectors lengths by splitting tokens into\\nsub-tokens, we also have to remap the labels’ vectors to ensure that each token is associated\\nwith its correct label. After that, we had to pad and truncate all the sequences according to the\\npre-trained maximum length parameters.\\n7. Fine-tuning\\nWith the data processed, we started fine-tuning the model for the archival context.

ARCANO - Smart Annotator\\nThe key to obtaining good results in this subfield is the training data quality. The closer the\\ntraining data is to the data in which this technology is intended to be used, the better the results\\nwill be. Good training material is not always available, which creates the need to annotate text.\\nNormally, this activity is performed manually by an experimenter who is knowledgeable about\\nthe domain of the documents. However, this task can become time-consuming and tedious\\ndespite its low complexity. Thus, the idea of developing an intelligent tool to support text\\nannotation, ARCANO [11], was born.\\nThis annotator aims to intelligently assist the entire annotation process using ML models\\nto try to predict named entities of the texts we want to annotate. The idea is to use a generic\\nmodel to find entities in a small fraction of the target dataset. Then, by correcting the entities\\nfound, we teach the model how to classify entities in our specific domain, iteratively.\\nThe sequence diagram in Appendix Aillustrates ARCANO ’s annotation workflow. Initially,\\nthe experimenter imports the entire target dataset for it to be annotated. Then, this dataset is\\ndivided into 𝑁batches that will be used to train the ML model. Firstly, the first batch is sent to\\nthe server to identify and classify the entities it can find. Then, the result is sent to the client\\nto be corrected by the experimenter. Now that we have validated training data, we can use it\\nto refine the ML model. Thus, the correctly annotated data is sent to the server to train the\\nmodel as well as the second batch so that the trained model can extract new entities from it.\\nThe more annotated batches, the higher the amount of training data, making the model learn\\nhow to classify entities even better. This makes the experimenter annotate fewer and fewer\\nentities manually. The greater the autonomy degree of the model, the lesser the work of the\\nexperimenter. Finally, ARCANO joins all the previously annotated data into a file, enabling to\\nexport the fully annotated dataset.\\nThis tool was used to annotate a corpus from the ArquivoNacionaldaTorredoTombo , the\\nArquivodeOliveiraSalazar ’sarchivalfindingaids. Intotal,71397tokenswereannotated,making\\nmore than 7000 different entities. In the end, the annotation process was considerably easier\\nand faster due to the intelligent entity recognition system.\\n10. Conclusion and Future Work\\nInpreviousworksweobtainedhighF1-scoreresultsinNERusingotherMLalgorithms,however,\\nthe BERT model presented a great advance in the generalization. Using the knowledge obtained\\nduring its pre-training, BERT models were able to achieve higher F1-score results in a corpus\\nthat was not present in their training data (compared to previous architectures). Furthermore,\\nwe also concluded that annotating corpora with the developed annotator was much faster than\\ndoing it manually.\\nForfuturework,itwouldbeinterestingtoworkontheextractedentities,forexamplecreating\\ndisambiguation mechanisms, allowing to relate entities between different documents.', metadata={'source': 'fine_tuning_bert.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

In this paper, we are complementing the work already done by presenting a different NER\\nmodel with a new architecture, Bidirectional Encoding Representation from Transformers (BERT). In\\norder to do so, we used a BERT model that was pre-trained in Portuguese vocabulary and fine-tuned it\\nto our concrete classification problem, NER. In the end, we compared the results obtained with previous\\narchitectures. In addition to this model we also developed an annotation tool that uses ML models to\\nspeed up the corpora annotation process.\\nKeywords\\nNamed Entity Recognition, BERT, Web, Corpora Annotation\\n1.
